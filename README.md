# EyeDentify
A real-time smart text magnifying app for people with low vision. EyeDentify detects text, magnifies it, and then overlays the text in black and white over the original text. Zoomed in images may also have arrows pointing to other nearby text so that the user knows there's other text around.

Uses [Microsoft's OCR Computer Vision API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/) for the text detection.
